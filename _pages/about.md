She Yifei is an undergraduate student in Communication Engineering at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), expecting to graduate in 2026. He will continue at BUPT to pursue his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Kai Niu. His doctoral research will focus on the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the lens of semantic information theory.

His research interest includes information theory, mechanistic interpretability and representation learning.
